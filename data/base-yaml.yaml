# This file serves as a "yaml of yamls". It lists most of DR Lich's yaml settings, a description
# of what the settings do, the scripts that rerefence them, and the specific use case of the setting
# for the script that uses it. This file feeds DR Lich's robust help functions. Here is an exampe of
# how each settings section should be laid out:
#
# crafting_container: # This is the actual name of the setting as specified in base/character yamls
#   description: # This is the general description of the setting itself
#   referenced_by: # Here you should specify which scripts, by their script name, use this setting
#     - clean-leather
#     - carve-bead
#   specific_descriptions: # Here you should specify, by script name, the specific use of the setting
#     clean-leather: Scraper, preservatives and cleaned hides go here.
#     carve-bead: Carving knife and shaper go here.
#
# If you are here to add a setting or script, please:
#   1) Search to see if the setting already exists here. If so, add your script and specific description
#   2) If your setting doesn't exist, please add the setting in the proper alphabetical placement
#      within the existing top-line settings name.
